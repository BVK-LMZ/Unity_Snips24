The Tic-Tac-Toe script functions by managing a grid of buttons, 
each associated with a TMP_Text component that displays the current player's symbol ("X" or "O").
The game starts with player "X" and alternates turns. Each button click updates the button's text with the current player's symbol if the button is empty. 
If a button is already filled, the click is ignored until a blank button is selected.

Winning Conditions:
The CheckForWin() function evaluates a set of predefined winning patterns to determine if there is a winner. 
Each pattern is represented by indices corresponding to buttons that must contain the same symbol.
The function checks each pattern to see if the buttons in that pattern all contain the same text and are not empty. 
If such a pattern is found, it logs a win message and exits the method.

Draw Conditions:
After checking for a win, the script then checks if all buttons are filled by iterating through each button. 
If every button's text is non-empty and no winning pattern has been found, the script declares a draw and logs a corresponding message.

Improvements:
To enhance the script, it could include functionality to stop the game when a win or draw is detected, 
preventing further clicks. Additionally, adding visual or textual indicators for invalid moves and game status would improve user experience.
